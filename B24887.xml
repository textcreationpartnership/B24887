            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>ANd now, Excellent Sir, I shall crave leave to make the same profession, that ANNAS the high Priest, and CAIPHAS did when they saw what was done by PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, Acts 4.16.</p>
            <p>It is manifest that a notable miracle hath been done, and we cannot deny it, but must confess (as our Saviour did of the man that was borne blinde, Joh. 9.3.) the works of God are manifest in this childe by this miraculous cure: For my part therefore I cannot but acknowledge (and heere I shall make bold to express my selfe almost in the same manner that NICODEMUS did unto our Saviour,) that his Sacred Majesty (now with God) was a Physitian that was sent from God; for the Reliques of no man could doe such miracles, except God had been with him, John 3.2. And I hope it may be lawfull for me to say, as Saint Peter did, Acts 2.22. that he was a man approved of God by miracles, wonders, and signes, which God had done by him. As then the blind man in the Gospel, John 9.30. told the Pharisees, that it was a marvellous thing, that they should not know from whence his Physitian was, who had opened his eyes: so shall I from henceforth tell any man that doubts of our Soveraignes being with, and comming from God, that I marvell at him, since this relique (with Gods blessing) hath opened the eyes of a childe that was blinde, which ought to stop the mouths of all those ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling RABSHAKAH'S, <hi>Tumule quos sensimus hostes,</hi> who have lately standred the footsteps of the Lords Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and endeavoured to kill him in his grave. This one miracle (not now to speake of his sanctified life, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable expression of himselfe in his most divine Booke, which shews, though he were bodily here, yet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation was still in Heaven) may make it apparent (since it will be attested by so many hundreds of Brethren) to all good Christians, who will not wilfully blindefold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207795:5"/>that he is returned to God (who gave and sent him out of his especiall favour unto us) and that he is now a Saint in Heaven. And that your Lordship may also, after this painfull life is ended, raigne with him there, shall ever be the prayer of</p>
